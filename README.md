# mc-server-python
A Minecraft server setup script made using python3!
<p>Only works on MacOS/Linux</p>
This script lets you install a minecraft server on your computer very easily, you can customize it, and choose between a Vanilla server or a PaperMC(plugins+optimized). Hope you'll like it!

## Installation

To begin, python3 is required to run my script, install it via https://www.python.org/downloads/ . (Java is also required of course, download it at java.com or with your package manager)
<p>After python3 is installed, clone my repository:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/Yot360/mc-server-python.git</code></p>
<p>Then cd into the directory with</p>
<p><code>cd mc-server-python</code></p>
<p>After that, you'll need to download the required python modules with:</p>
<p><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>Finally, run the script with:</p>
<p><code>python3 setup.py</code></p>
<p>Follow the setup and your server will be up and running!</p>
