# mc-server-python
A Minecraft server setup script made using python3!


**NOTE: Only works on MacOS/Linux(Windows support in progress)**


This script lets you install a minecraft server on your computer very easily, you can customize it, and choose between a Vanilla server or a PaperMC(plugins+optimized). Hope you'll like it!

## Installation

To begin, python3 is required to run my script, install it via https://www.python.org/downloads/.
(Java is also required of course, download it at java.com or with your package manager)


After python3 is installed run `pip install mc-server-python`.
When pip is done installing the package run `mc_server_python`. Follow the instructions to get up and running!
